Short description of project
----------------------------
Disadvantages of the usual repeated measures analyses, repeated measures ANOVA and MANOVA, are the assumptions of sphericity and
homogeneity of covariance matrices, respectively. In this study a Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) approach to repeated measures is
proposed and investigated; a method that is not based on these assumptions. A simulation study was performed to compare the
robustness and power of the GLR approach, the repeated measures ANOVA, and MANOVA under various violations of aforementioned
assumptions and for different sample sizes. In addition, we applied the GLR on a existing educational dataset on teacher-student
relationships.

Running R-code or SPSS syntax
-----------------------------
Instructions about how to run the R-code or SPSS syntax are given in the files itself. The following versions of R and SPSS
were used in this study on a computer with Windows 10:
- R version 3.1.2
- package Lavaan version 0.5-17
- package MASS version 7.3-29
- package haven version 0.2.0
- package biotools 3.0
- SPSS version 24


Application existing educational data
